Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br /> <br /> I hope you are doing well. My team spoke to yours a while back regarding [PRODUCT]. It seems the timing wasn't the best and the conversation may have been pushed off.<br /> <br /> Not sure if your needs have changed, but I thought it might be valuable to connect for a few minutes about our latest offerings.<br /> <br /> Do you have 15 minutes this week or next to jump on a quick call to reconnect?<br /> <br /> Best regards,<br /> {{{Sender.FirstName}}}
