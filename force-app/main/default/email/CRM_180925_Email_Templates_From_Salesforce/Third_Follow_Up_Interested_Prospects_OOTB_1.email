Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},
            <br><br>
            Briefly following up on a few voicemails I've left your way.
            <br><br>
            Understanding that you're busy, when is the best time to catch you for a quick chat? If you are not the right point of contact, could you point me in the right direction?
            <br><br>
            Best, <br>
            {{{Sender.Signature}}}
